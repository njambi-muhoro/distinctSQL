## Distinct
is used to filter out duplicate values from the result set of a query. Imagine you have a table with a list of names, and some names appear more than once. If you want to see each unique name only once, you would use DISTINCT.

## EXAMPLE
Let's say you have a table called employees with a column named department, and you want to know all the unique departments:

### SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
This query would give you a list of all the different departments without repeating any department names. It's like saying, "Just show me each different department once, no matter how many employees work there."

So, DISTINCT helps in simplifying your query results by showing only unique values, making it easier to understand and analyze your data without unnecessary repetitions.

## Advantages
Eliminating Duplicate Entries: When dealing with datasets where the same value may appear in multiple rows, using DISTINCT helps to present a clean, unique list of values. For example, when working with a customer database, you might want to see a list of unique email addresses or unique product names.

Aggregation Operations: In situations where you perform aggregate functions (e.g., counting, summing) on a column, using DISTINCT can ensure that each unique value is considered only once. This is particularly useful when calculating metrics like the total number of unique users.

Data Exploration and Analysis: During the initial exploration of a dataset, or when trying to understand the distinct categories or groups within a column, DISTINCT can provide a quick overview.

## Demerits
However, it's essential to note that the use of DISTINCT should be mindful of performance considerations. Using it on large datasets or in complex queries might impact performance, and alternative approaches like grouping or indexing might be considered.
